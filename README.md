# Shapes TD Guidebook
This is the "tutorial" and "how to play" of the game. There is no
instructions in the game, and hence this should be referred to if
you have any difficulty in playing the game.
### Tutorial
To place a tower, press on the tower <u>once</u>, then click on the map
where you want it to be placed. You may continue to place towers until
you either don't have enough cash anymore, or you would like to stop.
To start the wave, press the next wave button:  
![Wave Start Button](https://i.imgur.com/wopAurq.png)  
Enemies will flow through the paths towards your stronghold, and it is
your goal to stop them before they reach your stronghold. Your
stronghold looks like this:  
![Stronghold](https://i.imgur.com/2elUynD.png)  
Your health, cash and wave # is displayed on the top right corner
of the game. Do not let your health be 0, or you lose the game :)
To pause the game, press on the pause button:  
![Pause](https://i.imgur.com/Br6w63O.png)  
Pressing the start wave button can get tiring. Why not use the
fast forward button? It automatically pushes waves without your
input. It is a toggle switch, and can be toggled between automatic
and manual.

Is there a tower you dislike? Sell it! You get half your intial
investment back, and your precious real estate. To sell a tower,
click on it, then press the sell button on the bottom right corner
of the game:

That is all you need to know to play the game for now. Below, I have
 listed all the towers, and enemies in the game, which should help
 you plan strategically. Good luck, and I wish your towers the 
 best!
### Towers
Towers are built to defend against enemies :)
##### The Bullet Tower
![Bullet Tower](https://i.imgur.com/WkAplU6.png)  

The bullet tower does medium damage, but only does damage to the
furthest proceding enemy. In addition, it also fires with a delay,
meaning it does not hit an enemy every tick. It is dirt cheap though.
Medium Range.

##### The Laser Tower
![Laser Tower](https://i.imgur.com/JiNcH2i.png)  

The laser tower does minimum damage, but does it every tick to the
furthest proceding enemy. Has a short range capability, and is not
that expensive.

##### The Freeze Tower
![Freeze Tower](https://i.imgur.com/maejT6V.png)  

The freeze tower freezes the furthest proceding enemy for a few seconds.
It fires on a medium delay, so place them strategically.Very effective
against bosses, but requires towers around them to be useful. 
Moderately ranged, and moderately expensive.

##### The Cannon Tower
![Cannon Tower](https://i.imgur.com/db4ZeNy.png)  

The cannon tower does incredible damage, but does so on a very slow
delay. Extremely effective against bosses, especailly when paired with
a freeze tower. Very ineffective against a rush of enemies. Very
expensive, but has an extreme range.

##### The Heart Tower
![Heart Tower](https://i.imgur.com/aaLzA3J.png)  

The heart tower does little damage over a period of time, however,
it yields 5 lives per kill! Great to build up lives over time!
It has an moderate range also.

##### The Volley Tower
![Volley Tower](https://i.imgur.com/WyJJy52.png)  

The volley tower utilizes special technology in order for it to
volley a shot at all enemy while it is shooting! Does little to
moderate damage, but is extremely effective against a large group
of enemies. Its weakness are bosses, does not really do anything
to them. Decently expensive to build.

##### The Machine Gun Tower
![Machine Gun Tower](https://i.imgur.com/z7JP7tq.png)  

The machine gun tower is a glorified laser tower. It does 25x more
damage than the laser tower, and also does the damage every tick!
Extremely effective against a rush of enemies.
The only downside is that it is insanely expensive, and the range
is tiny.

### Enemies
Enemies are designed to try and rush you and completely eradicate
your stronghold.
##### Color Variants
There are 7 colors of enemies. Each one is progressively more
diffucult that the last, and the 7th color is the boss (white).

![White Circle](https://i.imgur.com/JbBYOmv.png)

##### Shape Variants
There are 5 shapes of enemies. Each one represent the "stages" of
the game. The more sides the shape has, the more difficult it is.

![Purple Pentagon](https://i.imgur.com/y1D0ZSk.png)
![Purple Hexagon](https://i.imgur.com/sNidJfK.png)
##### Bosses
A wave boss occurs at the end of each "stage" (or each shape).
They are demarked by a distinctive white/grey color, with all 6
other colors as stripes. They are notoriously more difficult to
defeat than the regular enemies, however they move more slowly,
and only is one singular entity. They do often spawn with other
regular shapes as well, so be careful! They also do a lot of damage
to your stronghold if they hit it.

##### Hierarchy of Enemy Difficulty
Shapes take precendence over color. In short, the circles are the
weakest type of enemy, with the blue circle being the weakest,
and the white circle being the strongest out of the circles.
Triangles are generally harder that circles, except for a couple
at the beginning. Pentagons are the hardest, especially the white
pentagon.
